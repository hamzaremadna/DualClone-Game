# DualClone

## Description:
A simple multipeer game, where the player controls a spaceship with a joystick and shoots laser beams.

- The player can choose the ship.
- He can organize or join a game.
- The ship can go to the other player's screen.
- The player can shoot 10 times waiting for the gun to reload.
- If two players are playing, the session cannot be joined.
- If one player loses the connection, the other player will be automatically redirected to the main menu.
- If a ship is destroyed, the two players are redirected to the game scene where it is written whether they won or lost.
- The screen size of the players changes size when the game starts with the smaller of the two.
## Implementation:
- the possibility that a user's ship can move to the opponent's screen.
- Limiting the number of shots of the main weapon.
- Implementation of a logic that takes into account the resolution and size of the screen of each iOS device in combat.
